# Visual Studio Code Commands

### Introduction

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) \(VSC\) is a code editor with a common user-interface.  It basically has an Editor, Side-bar, Status-bar, Activity-bar, and panels.  This page lists useful commands and short-cuts.  Understanding the user-interface better, refer to the [Visual Studio Code User Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) \([version 1.37](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_37)\) article.

### Command Palette

A few editor level commands from the command palette.  This is a productivity booster.

* **Ctrl+P** - opens an action search dialog.  From here navigation to anything is possible.  For example, opening a project file, e.g. Program.cs, using Ctrl+P lists files to select from, probably whet the EXPLORER panel is hidden.
* **Ctrl+Shift+O** - allows navigation to a specific symbol in a file, useful for long files.
* **Ctrl+G** - Goto a line in code.
