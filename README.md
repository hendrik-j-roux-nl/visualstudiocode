# Visual Studio Code

### Introduction

The first time I opened Visual Studio Code I closed it because I had no idea how it works.  However, since then--the time of the simians--evolution has come to my aid with a more sentient approach.  As I progress to sapience I'll keep a scroll of notes pertaining.  The purpose of this publication is just that, i.e. my random scribbles about using Visual Studio Code en-route to illumination.

Visual Studio Code \(VSC\) is a free [open-source](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-open-source-software-makeuseof-explains/) tool available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), available under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).  Microsoft specific customisation are released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).   The daily, latest release, is obtainable from [Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).  Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio are only related in as far as Microsoft maintains both.  VSC is similar to [Atom ](https://atom.io/)and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
