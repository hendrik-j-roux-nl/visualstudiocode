# Visual Studio Code

### Introduction

The first time I opened Visual Studio Code I closed it because I had no idea how it works.  However, since then--the time of the simians--evolution has come to my aid with a more sentient approach.  As I progress to sapience I'll keep a scroll of notes pertaining.  The purpose of this publication is just that, i.e. my random scribbles about using Visual Studio Code en-route to illumination.
